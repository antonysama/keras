#### Keras_classification (a tensorflow-api)
##### My keras_classification model uses the same datasets as my sklearn model and improves its accuracy significantly *  (see strengths *).
###### Instructions: First install & import the libraries together for the keras model and the sklearn model (https://github.com/antonysama/sklearn). Second, use the data and script from sklearn model to produce the vector x_train, which is used by both models. Third, run the script for keras_classification. 
#####  * Strengths: The keras model increased my training accuracy from ~80 % to ~100 % *  using the same datasets . However, the keras model test accuracy is  ~80%.
#####  Limitation: 100% training accuracy indicates an overfit.
