#### Keras_classification 
##### Keras is a tensorflow-api. My keras classification model uses the same datasets as the sklearn model and builds on it.
###### Instructions: First install & import the libraries together for the keras model and the sklearn model (https://github.com/antonysama/sklearn). Second, use the data and script from sklearn model to produce the vector x_train, which is used by both models. Third, run the script for keras_classification. 
#####  Strengths: This model increased my training accuracy of my sklearn model by ~20 % (using the same datasets ); keras test accuracy  ~80% 
#####  Limitation: 100% training accuracy indicates an overfit.
