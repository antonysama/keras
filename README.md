#### Keras_classification 
##### Keras is a tensorflow-api, which increased the training score of sklearn classification I did on the same data set by ~20 %.)
###### Instructions: First install & import the libraries together for keras_classification and for sklearn classification (https://github.com/antonysama/sklearn). Second, use the data and script from sk_classificn to produce the vector x_train. Third, run the script for keras_classification. 
#####  Strengths: increases training accuracy to ~100% ; test accuracy  ~80% 
#####  Limitation: 100% training accuracy indicates an overfit.
